# Bash problems

*Oliver Todreas 2025*

## Procedure

You are in the directory `root/scripts/answers/bash`. You need to be inside
this directory to generate reproducible results. As stated in the usage section
of the code documentation inside the file `TodreasQ1.sh`, simply run the file
with no arguments besides the file name itself like so:

```bash
bash TodreasQ1.sh
```

The filename template that the script uses to match filenames is hardcoded. You
must therefore execute the script as described above inside this directory.
