# Python problems

*Oliver Todreas 2025*

## Procedure

You are in the directory `root/scripts/answers/python`. You need to be inside
this directory to generate reproducible results. As stated in the usage section
of the code documentation inside the `.py` files, simply run the files, and
when asked to input arguments, leave them blank for reproducibility. For
question2, run

```bash
python3 2.py

```
And for question 3, run:

```bash
python3 3.py
```

The inputs, outputs, and parameters have default values to ensure
reproducibility. However, you can still input your own arguments when prompted.
Note that when running the commands above, new output files will be generated
that have similar filenames to the output files already present, but with a
suffix at the end (eg. `_2.txt` or `_2.png`).

The file `input_Todreas.txt` contains input data for both programs. Note that
the file contains the two example sequences provided in the exam. Furthermore,
the example window size and motif are set as default values in `2.py` and
`3.py` respectively.
