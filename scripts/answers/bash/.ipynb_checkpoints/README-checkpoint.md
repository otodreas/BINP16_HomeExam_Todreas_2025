# Bash problems

*Oliver Todreas 2025*

## Procedure

You are in the directory `root/scripts/answers/bash`. You need to be inside
this directory to generate reproducible results. As stated in the usage section
of the code documentation inside the file `TodreasQ1.sh`, simply run the file
with no arguments besides the file name itself like so:

```bash
bash TodreasQ1.sh

```

The inputs, outputs, and parameters are hard coded to ensure reproducibility.
Note that when running the commands above, new output files will be generated
that have similar filenames to the output files already present, but with a
suffix at the end (eg. `_2.txt` or `_2.png`).
